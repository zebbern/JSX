- **`scripting`** ‚Äì Allows JSX to temporarily run scripts to extract JavaScript files, form endpoints, and links from the current webpage.
- **`clipboardWrite`** ‚Äì Enables the "Copy All" function, allowing users to copy JavaScript files, endpoints, or links to their clipboard.
- **`host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`)** ‚Äì Allows JSX to analyze the current webpage. However, the extension **only activates when manually clicked by the user.**

### Does JSX Share Data With Third Parties?

### Does JSX Use Cookies or Track Users?
